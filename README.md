# FeatureSelection

This program uses the nearest neighbor algorithm to select a subgroup of relevant features that have the highest accuracy that can be used to create a predictive model. 

The nearest neighbor algorithm is sensitive to irrelevant data so it is used within a "wrapper" function to perform the selections. This included forward selection, backword selection and a modified version of forward selection.
